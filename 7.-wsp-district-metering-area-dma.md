# 7. WSP District Metering Area (DMA)

1. #### WSP District Metering Area (DMA)

These are the polygons that represent a District Metering Area (DMA) used to measure the water getting in and out of the boundary to measure water balance. They are used to determine Non-Revenue Water (NRW), the water lost from the production point to the consumer point through physical and non-physical losses.
