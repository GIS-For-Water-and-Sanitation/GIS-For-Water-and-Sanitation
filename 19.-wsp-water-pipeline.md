# 19. WSP Water Pipeline

1. #### WSP Water Pipeline

These are polylines representation of water pipelines network from the water source to the consumer. They are normally categorized according to the functions which are:&#x20;

Water pipes come in a range of diameter/pipe sizes and are made of different material which includes: Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), Asbestos Cement (AC), Concrete,&#x20;

Galvanized Iron (GI), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE),&#x20;

Glass Reinforced Plastic&#x20;

Ductile Iron,&#x20;

Polypropylene Random Copolymer (PPR), Steel, Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride (UPVC).
