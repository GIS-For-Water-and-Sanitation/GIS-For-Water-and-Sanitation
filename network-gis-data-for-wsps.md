# Network GIS data for WSPs

### Network GIS data for WSPs

Majidata system utilizes WSP network information, water and sewer assets for displaying the geometry of network elements and attribute information in the entire country. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is the science of correctly representing network information as accurately as possible using a data model to assist in decision making processes. A standard GIS data model is developed not only to enhance the use of the Majidata system but also to harmonize network information into a common data structure that improves data quality.

The purpose of this guide is to provide information on how to prepare GIS network information by using the developed GIS standards, data structure, and data formats.

### Understanding System Architecture

The development GIS database used in the Majidata system is PostgreSQL and PostGIS. It is a free and open-source relational database and can be adopted by WSPs who intend to use their own GIS system. PostgreSQL and PostGIS can be used together with open-source GIS software QGIS for daily update of network information, analysis, and reporting.

### Harmonization of GIS data

Water network information is unique for each WSP depending on the definitions given by the GIS departments. However, the differences in definitions does not mean there is no similarity among GIS layers. A harmonizing factor makes all network information standard for all water utilities GIS data. A network layer in GIS systems should have transferable format within WSP such as GIS data format, a coordinate system, and attribute information.
