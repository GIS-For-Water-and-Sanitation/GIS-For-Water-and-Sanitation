# Understanding Network GIS layers

### Understanding Network GIS layers

#### Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

All network GIS data is in Coordinate Reference System (CRS) WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator

With the following properties

Units: meters

Dynamic (relies on a datum which is not plate-fixed)

Celestial body: Earth

Based on the World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble (EPSG:6326), which has a limited accuracy of at best 2 meters.

Method: Mercator

However, WSPs can opt to use other relevant coordinate systems depending on where they are located. The coordinate systems commonly used in Kenya are WGS 84, Arc 1960 Kenya zones. An illustration of Kenya zones can be visualized in the image below. Therefore, a coordinate transformation will be necessary to WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator, a web friendly system for the purpose of the Majidata system.
