## Conclusion

WSP Majidata users are able to prepare their network layers locally using the developed data model. Given the Network layers one can populate in GIS software like QGIS, style the layers according to the Majidata system with preferred styling. The layer attributes are similar to the WSP GIS system and can be easily interpreted and imported to the Majidata model.

WSPs that do not have a GIS data model, and GIS software can use Open-Source  GIS software, QGIS. With this guide a GIS office at the WSP can import the network information to the Majidata GIS data model and use it for the GIS system or upload to the Majidata system.&#x20;

Additionally the Majidata system allows for a WSP user to edit their WSP network information directly through the Majidata portal. Further hands-on training enhances the user to rapidly perform the Network data migration to Majidata.
